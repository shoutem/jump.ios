Today, Marketing Pilgrim published an update of this data in the aggregate across 300,000 sites using Janrain Engage.  We are also spotlighting several key verticals, Europe and the mobile space. Beyond simply measuring the relative success of each identity provider by their user volumes, we are digging deeper to measure the relative reach and influence of each network across a number of key vertical market segments.  We define reach in this case as the popularity of each social network as a provider of online identity for user login across the web, and influence as a social network's ability to drive traffic to a website via social sharing. Across the 300,000 websites using Janrain Engage, Google remains the most popular provider.  Facebook has improved its position by 3% compared to three months ago, and Twitter's overall share has improved from 5% to 7% of overall login preference.  Yahoo! has held constant at 14% share.        An analysis of various industry verticals tells a different story.  Yahoo! was the prevailing provider among news media companies three months ago, comprising 34% of social logins on sampled sites.  During the past quarter, Facebook's share in this segment has grown at the expense of Yahoo!, Google and AOL.  Despite the moderate decrease this quarter among the 25 sites sampled, news media sites remain one of Yahoo!'s highest-performing verticals in terms of social login preference.  Keep an eye on Twitter, as it improved from 4% to 6% share in this vertical over the last quarter.    There is considerable diversity in login preferences between news and magazine sites.  Facebook is the clear leader for magazine publishers, with 49% of users on sampled sites preferring to sign-in with a Facebook identity.  However, this number has declined 8% from last quarter largely due to the moderate emergence of Windows Live and AOL at 4% share apiece. Google and Yahoo! have held steady as the second and third most popular networks within this market segment.        Among entertainment and gaming sites, Facebook leads by a considerable margin, which is not altogether surprising given the popularity of social games on the web and particularly within Facebook communities.  Windows Live is a surprising second choice in this vertical.  Among the 12 entertainment companies comprising this sample, several are European social gaming sites, a geographic region where Windows Live performs relatively well.  More on this later.        Among the more than 150 music sites sampled, including those of popular artists, Facebook maintains the lead it held three months ago.  However, it's important to note a 5% decline in relative popularity as a social login provider compared to last quarter.  The biggest winner in this segment is Google, which improved from 8% share to 17%, overtaking Twitter for second place.  Google's spike is indicative of an expanded sample size, particularly in South America where Google/Orkut is an established provider.        Perhaps more than any other vertical sampled, the social login preferences in the retail vertical have remained most constant.  Facebook continues to be the most popular network, picking up 2% share relative to last quarter, but Google and Yahoo! also perform fairly well.  We anticipate accelerated adoption of social login technology in the retail space in 2011.  Watch this blog for future updates.    For the first time, we have compiled data on the most popular networks for social login on mobile devices, compiled from a sample of entertainment, technology, non-profit and online guide sites using Janrain Engage for iPhone.  Facebook and Google lead the pack at 34% and 30%, respectively, while Twitter is twice as popular a sign-in provider on the iPhone.  This is expected given the percentage of Twitter users who access the service via mobile devices.        We've also included non-profit sites for the first time, and see a distribution similar to other verticals.  What accounts for this?  Many non-profit sites function as commerce/retail sites to fundraise, as well as content/media sites to promote causes or community/entertainment sites to facilitate engagement.          Similar to last quarter, we want to note that Windows Live remains twice as popular a social login provider in Europe as in the US, and its share has increased from 8% to 11% despite the emergence of more localized social networks and email providers.  These providers, such as Hyves (Netherlands), Netlog (Belgium), Web.de and GMX (Germany) comprise over 10% of social logins from our sample of 20 European customers.  Their growth in social login popularity across the Atlantic comes at the expense of Google, Twitter and Yahoo!        As we've discussed on this blog, social login is only part of the equation, and Janrain's savviest customers utilize social sharing to increase site traffic and build online word of mouth.  Facebook and Twitter dominate at 61% and 35%, respectively, with Facebook earning a 6% increase from last quarter.  However, 17% of users on Janrain Engage customer sites also like to share to their Yahoo! or MySpace communities.  Yahoo! Updates has increased in popularity as a sharing destination during the past three months, up 3% from last quarter.  Keep an eye on LinkedIn, which is growing increasingly popular as a sharing destination, especially on B2B sites.        One thing to note with this data - Janrain Engage supports sharing to multiple social networks simultaneously, enabling users to share a purchase, article comment, high score in a game or other activity with friends on all the major social networks at once.  Janrain customers generate an average of 12 new referral visits to their site for each activity shared to a social network. This data point is indicative of the power of making it easy for users to share activities from a website to their social networks. Given that last quarter the average was 9 new referral visits for each social post, we have seen a 33% increase in just a quarter. So what are the key takeaways from this data?  If your organization is just beginning to think about adopting social login or sharing, these findings can serve as a benchmark for your industry.  The social space is evolving rapidly, and in order to maximize return on investment and position your organization for sustained future success, it is best to cast a wide net and incorporate social login and sharing technologies that support multiple social networks and identity providers.

Website administrators, and more specifically online marketing managers, can easily modify the choice of social networks offered for the purposes of signing into the site without needing to reconfigure the mappings. Screen shot below shows the initial configuration of profile mappings via the Drupal administrative interface.   Configuration of social networks used for signing in shown below.  To see this Engage for Drupal 7 in action and experience the sign-in and social sharing experience from the perspective of your website users, click here. Please let us know what you think.

Anyone had the ability to create a working group by writing down a topic on a card and announcing it the group. We then stuck the cards to a wall in columns under various 1-hour time slots and assigned one of the many available meeting places to each card. Because of this format, the sessions were all focused on the most current topics that were relavent to the group.&nbsp;Attendees were encouraged to only attend meetings in which they would be actively engaged.</p> <p>The sessions for IIW 11 seemed to revolve around a few major themes:</p> <ul> <li>Refinement and convergence of standards / protocols under developmentï»¿ï»¿</li> <li>Personal Data Stores</li> <li>Activity Streams</li> <li>Vendor Relationship Managementï»¿</li> <li>New paradigms for Authentication, Authorization, and Social Sharing</li> </ul> <p>There were more interesting sessions to attend than there were hours in the day. Here are the highlights from a few that were interesting to me:</p> <p>  <strong>Relying Party (RP) Best Practices</strong><br />   Google presented the results of their research on <a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/oauthgoog/UXFedLogin/loginlogic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Relying Party Best Practices</a>. One of the common problems that RPs face is how to give users the flexibility to login through multiple identity providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) while still mapping each user to a single account on their system. <a href=&quot;/products/engage&quot;>Janrain Engage</a> solves this problem for RPs by providing an <a href=&quot;https://rpxnow.com/docs#mappings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>account mapping API</a>. Beyond that, though, what are the best practices for guiding a user through the sign-up / sign-in flow to minimize confusion and maximize conversion rates? Some interesting UI paradigms and suggested best practices were presented.</p> <p>  <strong>Stanford University Project</strong><br />   Stanford professor <a href=&quot;http://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Monica Lam</a> hosted a couple of sessions on a <a href=&quot;http://mobisocial.stanford.edu/index.php#mrprivacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>social networking platform</a> under development at Stanford. The goal of the platform is to provide an open, decentralized environment that allows for a wide range of social networking applications to exchange data while still giving users complete control and ownership of their own data. The platform uses existing email protocols to transport JSON data between mobile, device, and desktop applications.</p> <p>  During the demo sessions at IIW, Stanford students demonstrated several applications built on the platform. One application used the very cool technique of connecting mobile devices together by having one device take a picture of a <a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>QR Code</a> displayed by another mobile device. The QR code contains the information necessary for another device to connect to the user and download the application required to interact with that user. Regardless of whether the platform becomes the standard, the demo gave a really interesting glimpse into the future of social networking, where ad-hoc social networking will become the norm.</p> <p>  <strong>Personal Data Stores</strong><br />   There were several sessions on Personal Data Stores (PDS), which are repositories that individuals control and use to share information about themselves, including addresses, medical records, credit cards, etc. Envision a day when you no longer have to type in your address and credit card when you buy something online, but instead provision temporary and controlled access to these resources with the click of a button. Much like Janrain Capture provides a secure, cloud-based repository for web sites to store data today, PDSs will provide this capability to individual users in the future.</p> <p><strong>OAuth 2.0 leeloo Library</strong><br />   The OAuth 2.0 specification is not yet finalized (currently in draft 10), but we already have an<br />   implementation of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server. <a href=&quot;http://bitbucket.org/smartproject/oauth-2.0/wiki/Home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Leeloo</a> is an open source library written in Java that implements the current version of the specification.

Regardless of whether the platform becomes the standard, the demo gave a really interesting glimpse into the future of social networking, where ad-hoc social networking will become the norm.   Personal Data Stores   There were several sessions on Personal Data Stores (PDS), which are repositories that individuals control and use to share information about themselves, including addresses, medical records, credit cards, etc. Envision a day when you no longer have to type in your address and credit card when you buy something online, but instead provision temporary and controlled access to these resources with the click of a button. Much like Janrain Capture provides a secure, cloud-based repository for web sites to store data today, PDSs will provide this capability to individual users in the future. OAuth 2.0 leeloo Library   The OAuth 2.0 specification is not yet finalized (currently in draft 10), but we already have an   implementation of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server. Leeloo is an open source library written in Java that implements the current version of the specification. The authors, from NewCastle University, walked through the basic steps required to use the library to set up an OAuth 2.0 server.   Notes from the individual sessions at IIW 11 can be found here.",				"link" : "http://www.janrain.com/blogs/internet-identity-workshop-wrap",				"creator" : "Jason Cowley",				"date" : "Nov 5, 2010 11:52 AM",				"images" :				[					"/sites/default/files/identity-workshop.png"				]			}		},		{			"story" :			{				"title" : "Janrain is Hiring!",				"description" : "<p><img alt=%34%34 src=%34/sites/default/files/janrain-logo.png%34 style=%34padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px; float: right; width: 180px; height: 53px; %34 />Are you looking to join a passionate team at a leading startup in Downtown Portland?&nbsp;Janrain, the leader in user management solutions for the social web, is currently seeking a handful of innovative minds to add further potential to our already accelerated growth.

By using this library in your iPhone application, you can quickly authenticate your users on a number of existing providers (such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, etc.) and allow them to post status updates on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, and Yahoo! all through one screen, by configuring only one API call. This can be done in as little as two lines of code!</p> <p>Again, we are really interested in getting your feedback, and we hope that you can come.

To better test our library, we are hosting a Hackfest at our downtown office on Wednesday, October 27th from 6-9 PM. If you are interested in adding our library to your iPhone application, please come, and please bring your laptop. We will walk you through configuring your application with Janrain Engage and our 17+ providers (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), adding the library to your application, and the simple API calls. We will also provide pizza and beer, and we hope that you can provide meaningful feedback. In this version, we have streamlined authentication and added very easy-to-use social sharing. By using this library in your iPhone application, you can quickly authenticate your users on a number of existing providers (such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, etc.) and allow them to post status updates on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, and Yahoo! all through one screen, by configuring only one API call. This can be done in as little as two lines of code! Again, we are really interested in getting your feedback, and we hope that you can come. If you are interested in attending, please RSVP to iphone-dev@janrain.com no later than Monday, October 25th. We will be limiting the number of space to about 20 developers.

Fylde Borough Council is a Government district in the United Kingdom that provides a range of services for its citizens, including housing, parks, leisure, city beautification and environmental health.  Fylde's website provides information on local services and a community to stimulate engagement with local residents. The Challenge Fylde's key online objective was to increase engagement with community members and facilitate greater participation.  Fylde conducted several focus groups that revealed how users behaved on its site, and it became clear to the Council that requiring users to create a site-specific username and password posed a challenge to growing membership and providing a personalized user experience.  %34One of the things that always comes up is that people are sick of creating more user IDs for different websites,%34 said Andrew Cain, Fylde Borough Council's Transformational Services Manager.  %34That led us to seek a more open login process and find ways to encourage more people to login.%34   Fylde recognized that its online customer service tool (Get Satisfaction, a Janrain partner) made it easy for visitors to sign-in and share feedback with an existing account from Facebook, Google or Twitter, and determined that it could accomplish its online goals by extending such functionality to its own website. The Results Fylde launched Janrain Engage in mid-September and has experienced a 100% increase in registration rates compared to when only offering a legacy username/password system.  Fylde serves personalized content to registered users based on their location.  This has helped return visits and logins increase from 1.6 logins per user to 3.3 logins/user since implementing Janrain Engage, resulting in improved long-term engagement with Fylde residents.     Signups for email newsletters and alerts have increased substantially, helping Fylde keep users informed of local news and more effectively solicit feedback on Council policies.  Previously, only 24% of users chose to sign up for email alerts, but that percentage has increased to 87% since launching Janrain Engage.  Andrew Cain attributed this to the fact that users can easily share their email address from Google, Yahoo!, Facebook or other social networks when registering with the site, reducing the hassle associated with newsletter sign-ups. Forgotten password inquiries have also decreased dramatically by eliminating the need for users to create or maintain a Fylde password to access the site. Speed of deployment was a key factor in Fylde's decision to use Janrain Engage.  %34From a development point of view, it's been incredibly easy to setup,%34 Andrew Cain said.  %34The documentation was perfect and the setup was pain free.  We were able to set up a test deployment in about a day.%34 Longer term, Fylde plans to evaluate launching social sharing features, which would enable members to share local events with their friends on the social networks, driving increased traffic back to the Fylde website.

Nearly half of those adults (and 24% of all Americans) have posted comments or reviews online about the products they buy. Just among internet users, 78% of Americans conduct product research online before purchasing, and 32% post product reviews or comments online about their purchases. This coincides with the rise in popularity of social networks - nearly half (46%) of all Americans now use social networks, up from 5% in 2005.   We all know that consumers rely on peer opinions to help drive purchase decisions - this is not a new phenomenon.  However, with half of all Americans using social networks to share information with friends and colleagues, retailers have struggled to find a way to kindle brand conversations among consumers across these new media. The fusion of trends highlighted in the Pew study reinforces the mandate for retailers to make interactivity and sharing of product information and reviews as simple as possible.  For example, retailers using Janrain Engage can enable consumers to easily share product reviews with friends on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.      By leveraging Janrain Engage for social sharing, retailers can translate user-generated product reviews from their corporate website into peer-to-peer interactions on social network feeds.  This improves brand awareness, drives qualified referral traffic back to the corporate site, and informs future purchase decisions.
