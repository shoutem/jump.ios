# Xcode Project Setup Guide

This guide guides you through integrating the JUMP SDK into an existing Xcode project.

## Get the Library

If you haven't already, clone the JUMP for iOS library from GitHub: `git clone git://github.com/janrain/jump.ios.git`

**Important**: If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the library, see the `Upgrade Guide.md`.

## Add the Library to Your Xcode Project

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Make sure that the **Project Navigator** pane is showing. (**View > Navigators > Show Project Navigator**)
3. Open the **Finder** and navigate to the location where you cloned the repository. Drag the **Janrain**
   folder into your Xcode project’s **Project Navigator** pane, and drop it below the root project node.

   **Warning**: Do not drag the `jump.ios` folder into your project, drag the `Janrain` folder in.
4. In the dialog, do **not** check the **Copy items into destination group’s folder (if needed)** box. Ensure that the
   **Create groups for any added folders** radio button is selected, and that the **Add to targets** check box is
   selected for your application’s targets.
5. Click **Finish**.
6. **Warning**: If you are doing a social-sign-in-only (i.e. Engage-only) integration, you must now remove the
   JRCapture project group from the Janrain project group.
7. You must also add the **Security** framework, **QuartzCore** framework, and the **MessageUI** framework to your
   project. As the **MessageUI** framework is not available on all iOS devices and versions, you must designate the
   framework as "optional."

### Frameworks:

* Security - This framework is used to store session tokens in the devices security framework so that they are stored
  securely.
* QuartCore - This framework is used for animations when running on the iPad.
* MessageUI - This framework is used to integrate with the iOS device's native SMS and email capabilities, to allow
  your end-user's to share your content via email or SMS.

## Generating the Capture User Model

**Warning**: If you are integrating with social-sign-in-only (i.e. Engage-only), or integrating via the Phonegap
plugin, you do not generate the Capture user model. Instead, follow `Engage-Only Integration Guide.md`.

You will need the [JSON](http://search.cpan.org/~makamaka/JSON-2.53/lib/JSON.pm (version 2.53 or above) perl module. To
install the perl JSON module:

1. Make sure that perl is installed on your system. If it is not, consider using MacPorts or Homebrew to install perl.
2. With perl installed, install cpanm: `sudo cpan App::cpanminus`
3. Install the JSON perl module by running `sudo cpanm Module::JSON`

Once you have the perl JSON module installed you will run the schema parsing perl script to generate the Capture user
model:

1. Go to the Capture dashboard, and sign-in. (https://janraincapture.com)
2. Use the **App** drop-down menu to select your Capture app.
3. Select the **Schema** tab.
4. Use the Entity Types drop-down menu to select the correct schema. Wait for the page to reload. (If you are already
   on the correct schema, the page will not reload.)
5. Click **Download schema**.

With the schema downloaded, generate the user model:

1. Change into the script directory: `$ cd jump.ios/Janrain/JRCapture/Script`
   **Warning** `CaptureSchemaParser.pl` must be executed while from its directory.
2. Run the `CaptureSchemaParser.pl` script, passing in your Capture schema as an argument with the `-f` flag, and the
   path to your Xcode project with the `-o` flag:

   `$ ./CaptureSchemaParser.pl -f PATH_TO_YOUR_SCHEMA.JSON -o PATH_TO_YOUR_XCODE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY`

The script writes its output to:

`PATH_TO_YOUR_XCODE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/JRCapture/Generated/`

## Adding the Generated Capture User Model

Once generated, the user model must be added to your Xcode project:

1. Choose **File** > **Add Files to "Project Name"...** then select the folder containing the generated user
   model.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Make sure that your project builds.

## Working with ARC

The JUMP for iOS library does not, itself, use Automatic Reference Counting, but you can add the library to a project
that does by disabling ARC when compliling the JUMP library source code. To do so:

1. Go to your project settings, select your application’s target, and select the **Build Phases** tab.
2. Expand the section named **Compile Sources**.
3. Select all the files from the **Janrain** folder, including `SFHFKeychainUtils.m`
   Also select the generated user model files, if you added them.
4. Press **Return** to edit all the files at once, and, in the floating text-box, add the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler
   flag.
5. After adding the compiler flag, either click **Done** in the input bubble, or press Return.

## Upgrading from an Earlier Version of the JUMP SDK

To update the library references in Xcode, remove the JREngage group and re-add it.

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. In the **Project Navigator** pane locate the **JREngage** folder (group) of your Xcode project.
3. Right-click the **JREngage** project group and click **Delete** from the context menu.
4. Do the same for the **Janrain** project group.
5. In the dialog, make sure you select the **Remove References** button.
6. Re-add the project groups, following the instructions in this guide.

If you are doing an social-sign-in-only integration (i.e. an Engage-only integration,) see
`Engage-Only Integration Guide.md`.
